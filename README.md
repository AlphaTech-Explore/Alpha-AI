Alpha AI is a single-page web app for creating and iterating on web projects with Gemini Models. It allows users to describe their vision in plain English, and the AI will bring it to life in real-time.
Key Features:
Conversational code generation: Users can build a project component by component using a chat interface. The AI generates code instantly based on user input, such as, "Create a 'startup name generator' app," or "add a dark-mode toggle".
Live preview: A functional, interactive version of the app appears on the screen as the code is generated. This allows users to test features and see changes immediately.
Iterative refinement: This allows for continuous feedback. Users can tell the AI what to fix ("Make the buttons bright green," "add error handling for invalid input"), and it will update the code.
Effortless prototyping: This accelerates workflow from concept to working prototype in a single, streamlined process. It is a way to turn an idea into a functional, shareable web app.
Multimodal input: Users can use sketches, images, or files as inspiration for the AI to start from. This makes the creative process more fluid.
Alpha AI is suitable for indie hackers, designers, and non-developers who want to build and experiment rapidly. It is a new, more intuitive way to build softwareâ€”less about the code and more about the creative "vibe".
