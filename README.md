# Alpha AI
Alpha AI is a single-page web application designed for rapid prototyping and iterative web development. It uses advanced Gemini Models. It provides a conversational interface for developers, designers, and hobbyists. This helps turn ideas into functional, real-time web projects. 
Key Features
- Conversational Code Generation: Build web projects component-by-component by chatting with an AI. Use plain English requests like, "Create a startup name generator" or "Add a dark-mode toggle," and the AI instantly generates the code.
- Live Preview: See your project come to life as you chat. A functional, interactive live preview updates in real-time, allowing you to test features and see changes instantly.
- Iterative Refinement: Accelerate your workflow with continuous feedback. Instruct the AI to make changes, such as "Make the buttons bright green" or "Add error handling," and the code is updated on the fly.
- Effortless Prototyping: Streamline your process from concept to a shareable web app. Turn your ideas into functional prototypes faster than ever before.
- Multimodal Input: Go beyond text. Use sketches, images, or files to provide the AI with inspiration, making the creative process more fluid and intuitive. 
# Who is it for?
- Indie Hackers: Rapidly build and test new ideas without getting bogged down in boilerplate code.
- Designers: Bring design mockups to life with a conversational interface, no coding expertise required.
- Non-Developers: Experiment with building software in a new, intuitive way that focuses more on the creative "vibe" than the code.
